      Project 3

This project is a continuation of your project 2 to include step 3 and step 4 of the Huffman coding algorithm
steps (there are four algorithm steps, see below, will be asked in exam-1).
Re-use your codes in your project 2; however, in order to implement steps 3 and 4, the list nodes in your
project 2 will need to be modified to become tree nodes.
 
After the tree construction, you are to traverse the Huffman binary tree in the order of:
	a) pre-order 
	b) in-order
	c) post-order
	
	
Note:  Huffman encoding and decoding will be our project 4.

I. Input: A file contains a list of <char prob> pairs with the following format. The input prob are integer,
has been multiplied by 100, i.e., a prob equal to .40 will be given as 40, char should be treated as string. 

Example:

char1  prob1  
char2  prob2
char3  prob3
:
:
charn  probn  



II. Outputs: 
- outFile1: A text file containing the Huffman <char	code> pairs 
- outFile2: A text file containing the pre-order, in-order, and
post-order traversals of the Huffman binary tree
- outFile3: for your debugging outputs. See output format below for detail.
