      Project 6:
There are four (4) run-length encoding/decoding methods. In this project, you are to implement Method #1. 

Method #1:  include zero and no wrap-around. 
Method #2:  without zero and no wrap-around.
Method #3:   include zero and wrap-around.
Method #4:   without zero and wrap-around.


I. Input: a txt file representing an image (gray-scale or binary), where 
	the first text line has 4 integers, representing the "header" of the input image  	
numRows, numCols, minVal, maxVal, follows by rows and cols of pixel values (integers).
   
	Example-1 for gray-scale image,
	
5 8 0 9  // The image has 5 rows, 8 columns, min value is 0 and max value is 9
0 0 8 8 8 8 9 9
9 0 7 7 8 8 9 0
0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 1 1 8 8 2 2
3 3 1 1 5 5 5 0
   
II. a) Encoded file (NOT from args): to be created during the run-time, to store EncodeMethod1.
The format for the result of an encoded image is given below. 

		5 8 0 9 
		1   	
    0 0 0 2 	
    0 2 8 4  	
	  0 6 9 2  	 
 :
   
        b)  Decoded file (NOT from args):  is created during the run-time to store EncodeMethod1_Decoded.
